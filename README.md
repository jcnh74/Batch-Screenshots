Batch Screenshots
=====================

Using ImageMagick we batch a group of png filled directories into screenshots for the App Store

First
- install ImageMagic via [This Link](http://www.gctv.ne.jp/~yokota/magick/#mem1)
- change script permissions like this `chmod 700 ./sshot.sh`
- run bash `./sshot.sh ~/Desktop/stickers/` where `~/Desktop/stickers/` is the directory with all your sticker directories

Todo
- place screenshots into created Screenshot directories
- include multiple versions of screenshots.
